#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### What do I do from here?

1. I am running the project from python version 3.6.5 using the integrated terminal within Visual Studio code. The command that works for me is `python -m http.server 8000`. 

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.

Steps to complete
1. Fork and clone the server repository. Use the development server to develop your project code.

2. Change the data source for your restaurant requests to pull JSON from the server, parse the response and use the response to generate the site UI.

3. Cache the JSON responses for offline use by using the IndexedDB API.
Follow the recommendations provided by Lighthouse to achieve the required performance targets.


### How to Run Project
1. Start Main presentation view on port 8000 with: python -m httpserver 8000
2. Run Sails by opening terminal on the server folder with: node server
3. Display Live reload of project on port 9000 by opening a node server in terminal from anywhere in project with: gulp serve
